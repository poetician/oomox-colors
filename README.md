# oomox-colors
Because I have a knack for discarding old data, here is some that's still new. The Lxappearance themes made in an initial run exploring Oomox are what remains, but I failed to backup more than a handful of the colors files to external storage during an impromptu re-installation. Besides, I'd rather make a new theme than extract an approximation from an old one.
